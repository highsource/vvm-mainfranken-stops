# vvm-mainfranken-stops

This is a simple script to download [VVM](http://www.vvm-info.de) stops as [GTFS-compatible CSV](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/stops-file).

The script uses the following endpoint:

```
http://www.bayern-fahrplan.de/XML_COORD_REQUEST?&jsonp=&boundingBox=&boundingBoxLU={minx}%3A{miny}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&boundingBoxRL={maxx}%3A{maxy}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&coordOutputFormat=WGS84%5BGGZHTXX%5D&type_1=STOP&outputFormat=json&inclFilter=1
```

It starts from bounding box `(9.5, 49, 11, 50)` and works down to smaller quadrants.

The script produces CSV output in the following format:

```
"stop_id","stop_name","stop_lon","stop_lat","stop_code"
"3129592","Unterickelsheim, Unterickelsheim Ort",10.160896984399999,49.606709571900005,"de:9675:29592"
```

# Usage
